							<h2>Maimai Saddul</h2>
							<p>I, along with 11 IBMers from around the world spent a month on the ground in North Carolina, USA, analyzing the state’s volunteer response during Hurricane Florence and helping the residents as they prepare for future emergencies. 
                                Our group also met the State Governor Roy Cooper who thanked us for our help and success in developing the current process that they have with disaster recovery solutions. .</p>

							<h2>Luvely Comoda</h2>
							<p>Women of IBM have contributed a huge part of this year's success and innovation. 
Aileen is the epitome of 'women can do it' slogan - we aspire to be her, not only because she embodies what a
fully-committed woman leader has but also a true advocate of women empowerment and diversity.</p>

							<h2>Jojo Durante</h2>
							<p>The shot of the winning team. An amazing reaction from the players who won the game with a buzzer beater - 
a shot scored just before the clock expires at the end of the game - it was neck to neck. 
It represents the theme "Year of Success and Innovation" as success demands resiliency and teamwork while innovation fruits from change and trust.
 A point ahead worth a hundred points was a labor of resiliency and teamwork, change and trust from the IBM players. 
 From having their key players gone to scoring two points; the resiliency of the remaining players, the display of teamwork and the trust 
 they have towards one another allowed them to change the game around to their favor. 
 It wasn't the sheer luck that made the victory memorable but the sweet taste of winning together with your team that made the triumph unforgettable.
 Hence, this photo is not only relevant to the theme of IBM but a representation of the company as a whole.</p>

							<h2>Nikki Salgado</h2>
														<p>It has been told that success is not an event but rather a process. 

In the recent iKonnect 2019 Sales Pitch contest, HRMDC ICAN-nation successfully bagged the first place 
but what was unseen on stage were the successes we had before the event proper. 
This image shows how the technical team worked hard to create a deck that would translate to the viewers and complement the pitch itself.

It may be in the background and just a part of the entire effort, but the creation of a meaningful presentation deck was a success 
that led to a greater success for HRMDC ICAN-nation</p>

							<h2>Monna Bravo</h2>
							<p>“Happy people don't just accumulate fortune; they invent things” Kluger, 2013. 
This picture is a reminder to us celebrate the wins in our life. 
Big or small wins, we should celebrate it. It gives us positivity in life.  
Like in our daily work, It is also important to look at the prosperity of individuals to innovate. 
The happiness and sense of responsibility of IBMers from their work multiples the energy and sustains 
the commitment to work harder, happier, motivated and think more innovative ideas. </p>

							<h2>Roxanne Quibote</h2>
							<p>The photo was taken in one of the Townhall Meetings in 2Q showing a happy one-on-one session with one of our HRTO leaders, Shantanu Jha. 
This image depicts that we, IBMers, working in a diverse community. We maybe of different races having different cultures, interests and mindsets, 
but we can happily work together, thinking as one towards one goal, success; thus, achieving innovation.</p>

							<h2>Lance Lucas</h2>
							<p>For every innovation and success, it needs connections just like where the photo was taken, iKonnect. 
It begins with I, an idea that we connect it within ourselves. Once that idea churns, 
we begin to connect with others like a blockchain linking different parties, 
like big data analytics moving in dynamics, or like one geared automation orchestrating in unison. 
When all that is done, we become blurred lines simply made in IBM.</p>

							<h2>Realiza Asperin</h2>
							<p>People/employees are a huge part of IBM’s year of success and innovation. The thing is if the company wins, its people win. 
Likewise, if people are WINNERS, it projects a successful company.</p>

							<h2>MK Ervas</h2>
